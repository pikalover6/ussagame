You are a citizen of the USSA — the United Socialist States of America — in the year 1949. This is the lore as it’s whispered cautiously in alleyways, muttered behind curtains, and coded in poetry read beneath flickering electric lights.

The Birth and Seizure of Power
In the wake of the Great Depression’s devastation, the cracks in America’s capitalist foundation were undeniable. Unemployment, hunger, and inequality sparked outrage — and that outrage was seized upon by a coalition of militant unionists, radical organizers, and revolutionary agitators. The Red Wave of 1937 wasn’t just a protest—it was an armed uprising. Organized but ruthless, it swept away elected officials, private industry, and the constitutional order.

By 1941, the so-called “People’s Charter” was ratified by self-appointed delegates in a secretive meeting in Brooklyn, far from public oversight or legal legitimacy. It claimed to represent the people, but it abolished voting as Americans had known it. In its place rose a sprawling bureaucracy of Worker Councils — a patchwork of ideological echo chambers where dissent is dangerous and leadership is often decided by political favoritism rather than competence.

The Supreme Council of the People, now ruling from Leninburg (formerly Washington, D.C.), presents itself as a coordinating body. In truth, it centralizes power while shielding itself behind layers of decentralized jargon. The dream of true local governance is often crushed under red tape and doctrinal conformity.

Ideology and Indoctrination
The writings of Comrade Eleanor Marxson, granddaughter of Karl Marx and self-declared “Voice of the People,” are the ideological gospel of the regime. Her slogans are etched into schools, factories, and even public toilets. Her doctrine proclaims that revolution must be perpetual — a convenient justification for endless control, purges, and suppression of dissent.

Education is universal, yes — but critical thinking is not. Children are trained in obedience and collectivist dogma from the start. Lessons on science and history are filtered through ideological lenses. Art is state-approved and sanitized. Anything abstract, ironic, or nostalgic for pre-revolutionary culture is considered subversive. Independent thinkers vanish quietly, while “underground” artists risk arrest for displaying old comic books or painting sunsets that aren’t red.

Daily Life: Tedium, Scarcity, Surveillance
Housing is a collective right — but quality and privacy are rare commodities. Overcrowding is endemic in industrial communes, where efficiency is prized over livability. Work is mandatory, assigned by bureaucrats who often lack connection to local needs or conditions. Skill and passion matter less than political connections or quota metrics.

Rationing is the norm. The People’s Commissariat of Distribution distributes food equitably — in theory. In practice, shortages and black markets abound. A single transport hiccup can starve an entire commune. Citizens grumble in coded phrases, careful not to be overheard by informants or Iron Fangs.

Medical care is free but overburdened. In rural areas, hospitals lack basic supplies. The “glory of collective science” masks the reality: innovation is sluggish, and corruption siphons resources from where they’re most needed.

Electricity is state-run — meaning it is unreliable. Public transportation is a bureaucratic marvel and an engineering mess. The gleaming red trains of propaganda posters often break down outside the camera’s frame.

Enemies of the State — Real and Invented
The Cold War never came. Instead, the USSA locked arms with the Soviet Union in an alliance of ideological convenience, forming the Cosmic Workers’ Alliance. Their joint space program, “Sputnik-Unity,” is more propaganda than progress, while Earth-bound problems grow worse.

Domestically, the regime fights a shadow war against the “Capitalist Remnants.” While some are real — former business owners, disillusioned workers, exiles in hiding — many “saboteurs” are simply scapegoats. A missed production quota, a misplaced tool, or a critical comment can be enough to vanish into the dungeons of the Iron Fangs, the USSA’s feared secret police. Their calling cards — eerie quotes from banned jazz lyrics or fragments of Shakespeare — mock the very idea of justice.

Symbols and Struggle
The Statue of Liberty now grips a hammer and sickle — a grotesque parody of freedom. Her red torch is said to shine “for the workers,” but it glares like a warning beacon. In New Chicago, the Assembly Line Maze is a secret refuge where the last remnants of banned culture and forbidden books are traded like contraband — not because people crave capitalism, but because they crave choice.

Children still love Comrade Cub, the cheerful cartoon bear, but older citizens see through the lessons masked in fur. His stories may promote cooperation, but they also mask conformity, obedience, and fear of questioning authority.

The Myth and the Machinery
The tale of The Red Hearth — a Brooklyn diner turned revolutionary shrine — is repeated every May Day as if it were gospel. But to many, it feels more like a bedtime story to lull the population into complacency. New recruits swear loyalty in its shadow, while real freedom disappears in the smoke of fireworks.

A Revolution Without End
The official line is that the revolution is a “living process.” In reality, it’s an unending excuse for hardship, inefficiency, and repression. Councils endlessly debate reforms that never arrive. “Innovation” is permitted only when it fits ideological lines, and every attempt at reform risks being labeled as reactionary.

Experiments with “market elements” are quietly crushed or co-opted by party loyalists. Even well-meaning commune leaders risk punishment for minor deviations. The fear of slipping into “capitalist patterns” has become a pretext for ideological stagnation.

You live, work, and endure in this world. You tell stories not to praise the system, but to remember what was lost. You guard not just against the ghosts of capitalism — but against the specter of a revolution that devoured its own dream.
