It began with a promise.
Bread. Work. Dignity.

In 1933, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt introduced the New Deal — a sweeping attempt to rescue America from the wreckage of the Great Depression. For a moment, it worked. The nation breathed again. But it was not enough.

Court battles gutted reforms. Corruption and inefficiency stalled recovery. Unemployment lingered. The people grew restless. Angry. Forgotten.

Then came 1937.

The Red Wave — a coordinated uprising led by militant unions, revolutionary theorists, and armed worker brigades — swept through cities and statehouses. Elected officials vanished overnight. Industrialists fled or were tried in workers’ tribunals. The Constitution was declared obsolete.

By 1941, the United Socialist States of America — the USSA — had replaced the United States.

No democratic vote ratified this new order. The “People’s Charter” was signed in secret, far from cameras or consent. In its place rose the Worker Councils — sprawling committees filled by loyalty, not merit. They claimed to speak for the people, yet stifled the very voices they claimed to represent.

Power now rests in Leninburg — once Washington, D.C. — where the Supreme Council of the People issues decrees veiled in jargon and ideology. The machinery of state is vast, but opaque. Decentralized in appearance. Utterly controlled in practice.

The writings of Comrade Eleanor Marxson — self-declared Voice of the People and granddaughter of Karl Marx — are the new scripture. Her slogans are carved into schools, plastered on food rations, and broadcast on state-run radio. “Perpetual Revolution,” she writes, is the only path to equality. In truth, it is the eternal excuse for control.

Children are raised not to think, but to comply. Art is approved by committee. Science is shackled by ideology. Even a jazz melody or an old novel can be grounds for suspicion. Creativity is suspect. Nostalgia is dangerous.

Life in the USSA is tightly regulated — in theory, for the benefit of all.

In practice?

Ration books are never full. Electricity flickers. Public transit groans under disrepair. Medical care is universal, but often unavailable. You are housed, but packed tightly, without privacy or peace.

And always — watching — are the Iron Fangs. The secret police. They hunt “saboteurs,” real and imagined. A missed quota. A wrong phrase. A song hummed from a banned composer. These can all be reasons to disappear.

The Cold War never came. The USSA and Soviet Union are now uneasy allies — the “Cosmic Workers’ Alliance.” They claim to aim for the stars. But their people still live in shadows.

In the cities, symbols of the old world have been rewritten. The Statue of Liberty now raises a hammer and sickle. Comrade Cub — a grinning children’s mascot — teaches lessons of obedience masked as kindness.

And yet… not all have forgotten.

In the back alleys of New Chicago, banned books are whispered over, not read. Old comic strips are traded like contraband. There, in the Assembly Line Maze, a different kind of revolution brews — not capitalist, but human. Quiet. Patient. Watching.

You are not from here.
Not yet.

You are a European journalist — an independent observer, one of the few permitted to enter this sealed nation. Your task is to report. To witness. To see what the revolution has truly built.

But the truth is buried deep. Behind slogans. Behind fear. Behind silence.

And now, the plane descends. Your papers are in order. Your suitcase is packed. Somewhere below, a city groans under red banners.

Welcome to the United Socialist States of America.
The revolution never ends.
And every question has a price.
